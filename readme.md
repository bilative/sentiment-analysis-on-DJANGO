### SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON DJANGO APP

- I warn you, all steps of the project is for adding emojis like ðŸ™‚ and ðŸ˜¤ to  movie comments (as sentiments).

I made this project in a day (as weekend project) to warm up with Django more and use a Bert Model / Transformers on it. 

Used concepts in the projects:
- Django web app,
- Flask Resp API
- Web Scraping
- Sentiment Analysis (with pretrained model)

-----

- I took the dataset from kaggle and used pretrained bert model on it. And checked if this pretrained model works well or not. (it is good enough) You can find it [here](NOTEBOOKS/part1_nlp_bert.ipynb).
- After this I needed header photos of the movies in tha dataset. (They are not included in the dataset.) So I made a little web scraping part in my project to take images. Actually I didnt take images, I only took their image urls. [here](NOTEBOOKS/part2_scrape_images.ipynb)
- And I put the preprocessing part of the sentiment analysis and pretrained bert transformers model in Flask Rest API. [here](REST)
- And lastly I made a simple Django app to show intermediate steps and the interface. [here](https://github.com/bilative/sentiment-analysis-on-DJANGO/tree/main/DJANGO_APP/MovieApp)

Dynamic url logic is little wrong in the project. Turkish characters in the url like /movies/tÃ¼rkÃ§e-Ã¶zel/ is not supported by Django. I realized it in the end but didnt fixed.
I didnt dockerized the app, because bert model required anaconda, I didnt try it to save time.
